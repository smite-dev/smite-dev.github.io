Welcome to my new blog! I'm so happy you are here!

I wanted to start a blog for two main reasons:
1. Share my limited but constantly expanding knowledge about the world, and hopefully help some people along the way :)
2. Improve my (written) communication skills.

I plan to blog about a variety of things. My main hobby interests lie in computing (specifically cybersecurity) so expect an abundance of content in that domain :) I also just enjoy writing. I consider myself a very versatile person with a diverse array of interest in quite literally everything. I enjoy introspection & reflection and am constantly looking for ways to improve myself. I don't even fully know what to expect from myself with this blog yet, but I'm so excited for what's to come.

Here's an AI-generated landscape image that I think is so pretty :p

<div class>
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/landscape.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>
